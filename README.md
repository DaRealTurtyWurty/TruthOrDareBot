# Truth or Dare Bot
A simple discord bot that allows you to play truth or dare with your friends.

## How to self-host
1. Download Java 21 or higher from [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).
2. Download the latest release (.jar) of the bot from [here](https://github.com/DaRealTurtyWurty/TruthOrDareBot/releases).
3. Go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
4. Go to the bot tab and create a new bot.
5. Copy the token and save it somewhere safe.
6. Invite the bot to your server using the following link: `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=8`.  
   Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the client id of your bot (or alternatively use the URL generator in the discord developer portal).
7. Create a new file in the location of your jar file called `.env` and add the following line: `BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`. 
   Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with the token you copied earlier.
8. Run the jar file using the following command: `java -jar TruthOrDareBot-1.0.jar`.
9. (Optional) Instead of having the `.env` file in the same directory as the jar file, you can also run the jar with the `-env` argument and specify the path to the `.env` file: `java -jar TruthOrDareBot-1.0.jar -env /path/to/.env`
10. The bot should now be running and you can use the `/truth` and `/dare` commands in your server.

Note: When running the bot in servers, it will create a `data` folder in the same directory as the jar file. This folder will contain a JSON file for each server that the bot is in. These files store the config and packs for each server.
